# Memory-Game
The Memory Game is a classic card matching game where players flip over two cards at a time and try to match pairs. The goal is to find all pairs with the fewest moves possible. This game tests both memory and attention, making it both fun and challenging for players of all ages.

How to Play

Match Pairs: Click on another card to flip it. If the cards match, they remain face-up; if they don't, they will flip back after a short delay.
Complete the Game: Continue matching all pairs until all cards are paired.
Finish: Once all pairs are matched, the game ends, and your score (moves and time) is displayed.

Timer: Track how long it takes to match all pairs.
Move Counter: Records the number of moves made by the player.
